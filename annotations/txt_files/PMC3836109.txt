Canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin for patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have adequate glycemic control with metformin plus sulfonylurea: a 52-week randomized trial. Diabetes Care 2013;36:2508–2515  In the print version of the article listed above, the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) data in conventional units (mg/dL) are not correct in Fig. 2C. The FPG data in SI units are correct; therefore, the conclusions do not change. The corrected Fig. 2C appears below.  The online version reflects these changes.
