TITLE: The Effect of Cromolyn Sodium and Nedocromil Sodium Administered by A pressurized Aerosol with A spacer
Device on Exercise-Induced Asthma in Children

ABSTRACT 
  ABSTRACT: To compare the effectiveness of cromolyn sodium (CS)
(10 mg) and nedocromil sodium (NS) (4 mg) administered
by a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer
device in preventing exercise-induced asthma (EIA), eight
asthmatic children with EIA were studied in a
randomized double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled
study, CS and NS provided significant, comparable protection
from EIA and both were better than placebo. We
conclude that CS and NS administered by a pressurized
aerosol with a spacer device provide equal protection
against EIA in children.
