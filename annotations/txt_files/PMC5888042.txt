TITLE: T202. HUMOR-SKILLS TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA: EFFECTS ON SYMPTOMS AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING

ABSTRACT 
ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND: Humor can provide a method of coping with a variety of stressful situations. Training of humor-related skills has proven effective in clinical samples, although humor training in patients with schizophrenia is relatively rare.

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.METHODS: In the present study, patients with schizophrenia have been randomly assigned to either a training of humor abilities or a training of social skills. Training effects on measures of psychopathology, psychosocial functioning and stress were compared between groups.

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.RESULTS: Preliminary analyses revealed that level of negative symptoms, stress and psychosocial dysfunction were significantly reduced in the humor group over the course of the training.

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION: These results suggest that humor training may improve important clinical and functional outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.
