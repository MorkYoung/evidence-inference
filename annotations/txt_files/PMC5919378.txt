TITLE: A Randomized Cross‐over Study of High‐dose Metoclopramide plus Dexamethasone versus Granisetron plus Dexamethasone in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy with High‐dose Cisplatin

ABSTRACT 
  ABSTRACT: We carried out a randomized, single‐blind, cross‐over trial to compare the antiemetic effect, for both acute and delayed emesis, of granisetron plus dexamethasone (GRN+Dx) with that of high‐dose metoclopramide plus dexamethasone (HDMP + Dx). Fifty‐four patients with primary or metastatic lung cancer, given single‐dose cisplatin (> 80 mg/m2) chemotherapy more than twice, were enrolled in this study. They were treated with both HDMP+Dx and GRN+Dx in two consecutive chemotherapy courses. On day 1, patients experienced a mean of 2.5 (SD=4.3) and 0,1 (SD = 0.4) episodes of vomiting in the HDMP+Dx and the GRN + Dx groups, respectively (P=0.0008). Complete response rate on day 1 was 45 and 90% in the HDMP+Dx and the GRN+Dx groups, respectively (P= 0.0001). Patients treated with GRN+Dx had a tendency to suffer more episodes of vomiting than the HDMP+Dx group on days 2–5, but it was not statistically significant. Twenty‐four patients (57%) preferred the GRN+Dx treatment and 14 patients (33%), HDMP + Dx. In the HDMP + Dx group, nine patients (21%) had an extrapyramidal reaction, and 5 patients (12%) had constipation that lasted for at least two days. In contrast, no patients had extrapyramidal reactions, and IS patients (43%) had constipation in the GRN+Dx group (P < 0.01). GRN+Dx was more effective than HDMP+Dx only in preventing the acute emesis induced by cisplatin. An effective treatment for delayed emesis is still needed.
