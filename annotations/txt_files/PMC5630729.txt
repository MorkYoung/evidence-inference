TITLE: Successful Response to Microbiota-Based Drug RBX2660 in Patients with Recurrent 

ABSTRACT 
ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND: Recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (rCDI) are associated with decreased diversity and altered intestinal microbiome compared with healthy patients. RBX2660, a standardized microbiota-based drug, is designed to restore microbiome diversity and composition in patients'. The effect of RBX2660 on rCDI patient microbiomes was evaluated by comparing pre- and post-treatment samples from PUNCH CD 2—a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.METHODS: rCDIsubjects were randomized to receive blinded treatments of 2 doses of RBX2660 (Group A), 2 doses of placebo (Group B), or 1 dose each of RBX2660 and placebo (Group C), by enema 7 days apart. Subjects submitted stool samples at baseline, day 7, 30, and 60 after treatment. Stool samples from responders to RBX2660 treatment per protocol defined as the absence of CDI for 8 weeks after treatment were compared with non-responders.  Relative taxonomic abundances at the class level were determined using 16s rRNA sequencing analysis for 94 stool samples from 45 patients in Groups A and C. Relative abundance data were grouped longitudinally using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. Analyses were performed based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution to compare group mean relative taxonomic abundances; Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were compared among groups longitudinally.

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.RESULTS: Baseline patient microbiomes were similar across response groups. RBX2660 treatment shifted the relative microbiome densities with taxa-specific increase in Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and decrease in Gamma-proteobacteria abundance. A larger shift from baseline microbiome was seen in responders to RBX2600 compared with non-responders (Figure 1). Microbiome changes in responders were durable to 60 days. RBX2660 treatment increased Shannon and Simpson diversity at 7 days post-treatment in responders but not in non-responders (P < 0.05).

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: RBX2660 treatment shifts patient intestinal microbiomes with greater alterations seen in those with a successful clinical outcome.  Funded by Rebiotix Inc., Roseville, MN.
