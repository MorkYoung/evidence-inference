TITLE: Risk factors for complications in peripheral intravenous catheters in adults: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial

  ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE::
analyze the risk factors linked to complications in peripheral intravenous
catheters. 

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.METHOD::
secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial with 169 medical and
surgical patients placed in two groups, one with integrated safety catheter (n=90)
and other using simple needle catheter (n=79), with three months follow-up time.


ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
the risk factors that raised the odds of developing complications were:
hospitalization between 10-19 days (p=0.0483) and 20-29 days (p=0,0098),
antimicrobial use (p=0.0288) and use of fluid solutions (p=0.0362). The 20 Gauge
lowered the risks of complications (p=0.0153). Multiple analysis showed reduction
of risk for the 20 Gauge (p=0.0350); heightened risk for solutions and fluids
(p=0.0351) and use of corticosteroids (p=0.0214). 

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION::
risk factors linked to complications in peripheral intravenous catheters were:
hospitalization periods between 10-29 days, antimicrobial infusion, solutions and
fluids and corticosteroids. Regarding complications, 20 Gauge is a protecting
factor compared with 22. Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry: RBR-46ZQR8.

BODY.INTRODUCTION:
Intravenous therapy is commonly used in hospitals, by inserting peripheral intravenous
catheters. Most catheters are removed due to the occurrence of complications, end of
treatment or absence of use
1
. The estimated annual use is about 200 million catheters in the United States of
America (USA)
2
. In Spain, approximately half of hospitalized patients receive an intravenous
catheter, being 95% of them peripheral
3
. More than 70% of patients admitted to hospitals require peripheral intravenous
catheters
2
. Other studies show the use of peripheral venous catheters in 86.4%
4
 and 80.6%
5
 of the patients.  In spite of this extended use, the use of peripheral venous catheters can lead to
complications such as phlebitis, obstruction, seepage, leakage and accidental
removal
6
, resulting in increased hospitalization and treatment costs, and patient
discomfort
1
. Understanding the risk factors for developing complications can facilitate the
task of daily care of the nursing team, and may help to produce knowledge and scientific
evidence to support the decision making of the nurses geared towards minimizing the risk
of peripheral intravenous therapy. Thus, the general purpose of this secondary analysis
was to analyze the risk factors related to the occurrence of complications in the
peripheral venous catheterization and the specific objective was to compare the
incidence of complications according to the type of peripheral venous catheter used:
integrated safety catheter and simple needle catheter. The main study, from which this
secondary analysis was derived, consisted in a randomized clinical trial that analyzed
the complications arising from the use and type of peripheral venous catheters in
adults

BODY.METHODS:
This is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, in which randomization
occurred by systematic random sampling, in two groups: integrated safety catheter and
simple needle catheter. The integrated safety catheter consists of a silicon covered
needle with double angle, tri-faceted bezel connected to the mandrel through metal guide
and handle; made of polyurethane biomaterial; it has full protection of the needle
device, activated after the puncture; wings with slots; transparent vinyl extender tube;
bio-selective reflux chamber filter cover; fast cutting clamp; two-way access composed
of female "Y" connector, one a Luer-Lok(r) connection and another with
removable male plug device. The short flexible catheter is of the needle type, with
internal safety device (triggered passively) and single-use, disposable flip, needing an
extender attached to it to let the infusion occur; the extenders used in the research
institution had valves, simple equipment and intermediate extenders, and two/four ways
access. The local complication of peripheral venous catheterization variable was the
primary outcome and included the occurrence of phlebitis, thrombophlebitis,
extravasation, seepage, obstruction, accidental traction and catheter site infection,
evaluated according to international guidelines
6
. The risk factors inherent to the development of local complications in
peripheral venous catheterization were secondary outcomes.  The survey was conducted in medical and surgical units of a large university hospital in
Curitiba-PR, Brazil. Participants were adult patients over eighteen years of age,
needing peripheral intravenous therapy. The objects of the study were peripheral venous
catheters, gauges 20 and 22 (G). Criteria for inclusion of participants: patients
needing peripheral venous access for IV therapy; hospital stay forecasted to be more
than 96 hours for medical and/or surgical treatment; one only inclusion in the study.
Exclusion criteria were: peripheral venipuncture impeded by the presence of capillary
fragility, and clinical conditions or local alterations that impaired peripheral
venipuncture. It is noteworthy to remark that the participation in the research was
subject to authorization of subjects or first degree relative by signing the Informed
Consent Form.  Collectors were trained prior to data collection, a team of two PhD students, two
masters graduates, four academic nursing and two nurses employees. They were trained
through meetings, lasting between one and two hours each, in order to standardize the
collection data and concepts addressed in this study (a 30 hours overall duration), as
well as during the pilot test run, which was carried out in pairs (a collector and a
researcher). The nursing staff of the units under survey also participated in this
training. There were 34 meetings, lasting 40 to 60 minutes, with attendance of of 109
employees, and it occurred by dialogued lecture (standardized concepts according to
international guidelines)
6
, illustrative video viewing and venipuncture workshop.  The collection period was from August to November 2014, reaching the number of
participants proposed by the sample calculation. To calculate the sample it was
considered an estimated prevalence of local complications related to peripheral catheter
in 52% for the integrated safety catheter group, based on pilot study data. The sample
size, an estimated 150 patients (75 in each group) ensured a 0.80 power (1 - β = 0.80)
for detecting a minimum difference of 20% between treatments at the 0.05 significance
level (α = 0, 05). The daily collection was done in pairs. In the collection there was
replacement of materials, update of the list of inpatients and authorization request
(informed consent), analysis of inclusions and randomization, reading of records, active
search for participants, direct observation of the punctured catheter in the patient,
and control of complications. A separate structured form collected data containing
socio-demographic, clinical, and catheter-related variables; as well as outcomes. The
patient was followed every day from the inclusion in research to the catheter
removal.  In the analysis of descriptive data we used absolute and percentage frequencies and
measures of central tendency and dispersion (average and standard deviation). In
univariate analysis, the characteristics of the catheter groups were compared using the
chi-square test, Fisher, Williams G, Mann-Whitney U and the binomial test of
proportions. In all tests it was established a significance level of 5%. It was applied
to calculate the relative risk (RR) and confidence interval (CI), jointly to multiple
analysis to estimate the degree of association between variables. The reference category
was indicated in the tables of results using the value 1 for the values of RR. The
multivariate analysis was performed with the variables with p < 0.20 and were
analyzed together to obtain a final model, using the Poisson regression model. The two
groups were compared according to the following variables: (a) socio-demographic:
identification, registration, gender, age, ethnicity, education, occupation and
inpatient unit; (b) clinical: length of stay, clinical diagnosis, comorbidities, type of
surgery (if present), presence of concomitant infection and its location, family history
of disease, smoking and alcohol use and outcome of hospitalization - discharge/transfer
or death; (c) data related to the catheter: date, time and number of puncture attempts,
length of time in days, anatomical site of catheter insertion, catheter use, reasons for
withdrawal, events, daily exchange and type of fixation used; and (d) outcome:
complications - phlebitis (including grade), thrombophlebitis, extravasation, seepage,
accidental traction, obstruction and local infection. The development of the study met
national and international standards of ethics in research involving human subjects and
obtained the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry number RBR-46ZQR8.

BODY.RESULTS:
The study include 193 eligible participants, from them 15 were excluded from the data
analysis (18 G gauge, puncture in different location of the upper limbs, exudation in
limbs and outlier - length of stay longer than 400 days - making it impossible to
compare the groups); nine participants refused or gave up participation (eight of them
after randomization), and 169 patients were included (90 in the group with integrated
security catheter and 79 in the group with single needle catheter); It evaluated only
one catheter per patient; and records were suppressed if they were not informed of the
statistical analysis. In the two analyzed catheter groups, the sample was homogeneous
and characterized mostly by randomized ethnicity, approximate age of 50 years old,
non-smoker and non drinker.  In the sample, the predominance fell in the males' medicine clinical ward, clinical
diagnosis of digestive diseases, no comorbidity associated, non-surgical procedures
during hospitalization, absence of infectious process and discharge as outcome.
Regarding length of stay, there was a longer duration (in days) in the group with
integrated safety catheter (Table 1). The higher
prevalence in both groups was of catheters caliber 20; location in upper left arm,
forearm region and puncture success in the first attempt. With respect to the purpose of
those devices, the prevalence fell on infusion of solutions and fluids, sedatives and
analgesics and other drugs (Table 1), but a
minority of antibiotics, electrolytes, anticoagulants, vesicant drugs and
corticosteroids were also used. Regarding the time of use, the majority of inserted
catheters remained a time equal to or exceeding 72 hours (Table 1). Among the reasons for withdrawal, hospital discharge,
followed by phlebitis were predominant. (Table1).  * Chi- Square Test † Mann-Whitney U Test; ‡ Williams G
Test  Complications rates are shown in Table 2. No
statistically significant difference was found between the two groups related to
complications. It is noteworthy that six cases of local infection occurred, one of
extravasation and one thrombophlebitis, which were left out of univariate analysis as
they represented a small number in the sample.   * Binomial proportion Test; † Williams G Test  The onset of complications during intravenous therapy may be attributed to several
factors. In analyzing the risk factors, among clinical variables, the length of stay
from 10 to 19 days increases the risk of developing complications in 1.36 (p = 0.0483)
and when this length is extended between 20 to 29 days, the risk increases in 1.61 (p =
0.0098) compared to the period from 1 to 9 days. There were no risk factors associated
with socio-demographic characteristics. Related to catheter variables, gauge 20 reduces
the risk of complications in 0.71 (p = 0.0153) compared to gauge 22; the use of
antimicrobials increases risk by 1.33 (p = 0.0288), in the same way that the infusion of
solutions and fluids increases it by 1.32 (p = 0.0362) (Table 3). The risk factors of the most frequent complications (phlebitis,
seepage, obstruction and traction) were analyzed by comparing the variables related to
the data of catheters among those removed without complications and those with other
complications (Table 3).  * RR Relative Risk; † CI Confidence Interval 95%  When crossing the data of all catheters that developed phlebitis with those who did not
develop complications, no variable related to catheter data was statistically
significant. In assessing the occurrence of phlebitis in total catheters, contrasting
the data with catheters that developed other complications, the catheter placement
period exceeding 72 hours was a risk factor for the development of phlebitis, increasing
its risk by 2.43 (p = 0.0085) (Table 3).  By analyzing the catheters with seepage, compared to catheters that did not develop any
complication, in total catheters, gauge 20 reduced the risk of seepage in 0.25 (p =
0.0005) compared to gauge 22. Catheters that had a successful puncture only after the
third attempt increase the risk of seepage in 6 times, compared to a single attempt (p =
0.0026). The use of antimicrobials also ranked as a risk factor for this complication,
increasing it by 2.65 (p = 0.0117). When comparing seepage with other complications in
total catheters, significant risk factors showed to be: 20 Gauge reduces by 0.35 (p =
0.0106) compared to 22; and the third-try successful puncture increases by 4.19 (p =
0.0185) the risk of seepage (Table 3).  Comparing the obstructed catheters with those without any complications, putting
together the total number of catheters, it appeared as the statistically proven risk
factors for the appearance of this complication the use of infusion of solutions and
fluids (RR = 4.5; p = 0.0037) and use of corticosteroids (RR = 3.91, p = 0.0081). Of the
total surveyed catheters, catheters with obstruction versus other complications, had as
risk factor for infusion of solutions and fluids (RR = 3.31; p = 0.0230). Correlating
catheters with traction outcome with catheters that had no complications, on the total
surveyed catheters, no risk factors were associated with the development of this
complication. By comparing the catheters that developed traction with those who had
other complications, on the total surveyed catheters, the region of the arm was shown as
a risk factor compared to forearm (RR = 5.43; p = 0.0408) (table 3).  Cumulative risk rates were estimated for all complications in the same manner for the
four more frequent complications in this study. There was no significant difference
between the curves (Figure 1). However, it was
noted that after the third day, the risk in the group that used the integrated safety
catheter is progressively shrinking, when compared to the group using simple needle
catheter. There was similarity between the risks of phlebitis up to four days with the
catheter, but from the fifth day on, phlebitis risk rate in the group with simple needle
catheter was close to 2.0, while in the group with integrated safety catheter was 1.0.
The cumulative risks rates for seepage are almost equal up to the second day, but after
the third day the risk rate in the group with integrated security catheter was close to
0.5 while being 1.1 in the control group. In the case of obstructions, the cumulative
risk rate is higher in integrated safety catheter group from the first day of puncture.
Cumulative risk rates are lower related to develop traction in the integrated safety
catheter group, and were were noticeable from the second day of placement of the
catheter (Figure 1).   xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

and traction. Curitiba, PR, Brazil, 2014
  The data relating to complications were examined through multiple regression analysis
using logistic regression. When referring to the total of catheters, there is a reduced
risk for developing complications by 0.75 (p = 0.0350) for the gauge 20 catheter; an
increased risk of 1.39 (p = 0.0351) for the infusion solutions and fluids; and increased
risk of 1.40 (p = 0.0214) for the administration of corticosteroids. In analyzing the
risk for complications, only in the group with integrated safety catheter, the variable
diameter of the catheter decreased risk by 0.57 (p = 0.0007); the shift in which
puncture was performed increased it by 1.51 (p = 0.0116); and the use of other drugs
also increased it by 2.61 times risk (p = <0.0001). As for the group using simple
needle catheter, the solutions and fluids administration variables and corticosteroids
increased the risk of developing complications by 1.66 (p = 0.0298) and 3.08 (p = 0,
0130), respectively, while considering the variable use of other drugs, the risk was
reduced by 0.66 (p = 0.0400) (Table 4).

BODY.DISCUSSION :
Regarding the socio-demographic profile, the population was homogeneous, predominantly
Caucasian, age groups in the 50's, balance between the sexes, no smoking and alcohol
abuse reports and absence of comorbidity, similar to the profile of several previous
studies of patients evaluating peripheral venous catheters

. Similar rates of complications in the peripheral venous catheterization are
found in 52%

 and 51.1%
3
 of catheters.  The findings show that the risk factors for the development of complications in relation
to clinical variables were: length of hospital stay between 10-19 and 20-29 days. Data
for this variable did not presented risk in other studies. When considering the caliber
of the catheter inserted, the present research indicated that the 20G reduces the risk
of complications compared to 22G. Other study corroborates the findings of this research
stating that small caliber catheters (22G and 24G) are 1.84 times more likely to produce
complications compared with large caliber (16G to 20G) (p < 0.0001)
18
. When performing multiple regression analysis in the total of catheters, we
found decreased risk for the development of complications in the caliber of the catheter
20, fact that was repeated separately in the group with integrated safety catheter.  It should be noted that the use of antimicrobial agents increased the risk of
complication in the catheter, just as infusion of solutions and fluids. In the
multivariate analysis regarding the development of complications for total catheters,
there was an increased risk for infusion solutions and fluids as well as for
corticosteroids. Considering only the group that used the integrated safety catheter,
the use of other drugs increased the occurrence of complications. In the group of simple
needle catheter, the variables administration of solutions and fluids as well as
corticosteroids increased the risk of complications, while the variable using other
drugs, reduced this risk. Another study shows that medication infusion results in
complications 1.41 times more frequent when compared to hydration solutions (p = 0.0006)
both in univariate and multivariate analysis (RR = 1.60, p = 0.006)
18
. In the cumulative risk analysis it was perceived that the risk to develop
complications in the integrated safety catheter group was increasingly smaller after the
third day as compared to the simple needle catheter group.  By comparing the catheters that developed phlebitis with catheters developing other
complications, having the catheter for more than 72 hours in place showed itself as a
factor that increases risk. A study, linking the catheter time in the vein with
phlebitis identified the development of this condition in 28% of catheters between the
fourth and fifth days of stay (p = 0.03)
19
. Another study showed that the probability of phlebitis development increases by
5% every 24 hours the catheter remains inserted in the patient (15).  Related to the length of time passed with the catheter inserted, the multiple analysis
of a study result in an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.010 for periods longer than 72 hours (p
< 0.001)
12
. Other authors say that a catheter inserted for less than 48 hours and by 49 to
96 hours has a positive risk of phlebitis of 5.8 (p = 0.000) and 2.8 (p = 0.002)
respectively when compared to the period 97-120 hours
17
. A binary logistic regression showed an OR of 2.72 (p = 0.000) when the catheter
is inserted for more than 48 hours
20
, contrasting with the previous study. The cumulative risk rate of this research
showed doubled risk for the simple needle catheter group after the fifth day of the
catheter insertion.  Divergent data to this research stress, through multiple analysis, that catheters placed
in the antecubital fossa (OR = 0.66, p = 0.0260) and forearm (OR = 0.52, p = 0.0080) are
less likely to develop phlebitis compared to those placed in the back of the hand
15
. Another study differs, referring that insertion in the forearm and arm compared
to hand/wrist increases the risk of phlebitis by 1.53 (p = 0.024)
18
. A logistic regression analysis carried out in 2013 showed a reduction of the
risk of phlebitis by 0.32 (p = 0.038) for catheters placed in upper limbs
21
. The stay of patients in orthopedic clinic (OR = 0.53, p = 0.034) and surgical
wards (OR = 0.61, p = 0.041) reduce the risk of phlebitis when compared to those
admitted to Medicine units
15
. Being woman is significantly associated with phlebitis through multiple
analysis, thereby increasing the risk by a relative risk (RR) of 1.64 (p <
0.001)
1
, RR = 2.44 (p = 0, 0003)
18
, and RR = 1.9 (p = 0.007)
17
. The age decreased by 0.99 times the risk of phlebitis (p <0.001) 
1
. Presence of diabetes as comorbidity increased the chances of phlebitis (OR =
2.42; p = 0.011)
20
. A gauge 18G or wider catheter increased the risk of phlebitis by 1.48 (p =
0.014)
1
, as well as the presence of an infectious process in the patient (RR = 1.41, p =
0.022)
1
. The use of antimicrobial agents was also an increased risk factor for phlebitis
by 1.48 (p < 0.01)
1
 1.87 (p = 0.013)
21
 and 2.4 (p = 0.002)
17
. The infusion of other drugs reduced the risk of phlebitis in 0.79 times (p =
0.009)
1
, but comparing the infusion of drugs with hydration solutions, there is an
increased risk of 1.55 (p = 0.02)
18
.  By analyzing the risk factors for the occurrence of seepage, comparing the catheters
that showed seepage with those without complications, the third puncture try increased
the risk by six times; the caliber 20G reduces the risk of seepage, while antimicrobial
use increases it in the total of catheters. By comparing the catheters with seepage and
catheters with other complications, there is a lesser risk for the use of 20G and an
increased risk for the third try puncture. In survival analysis, after the third day of
having the catheter placed, the cumulative risk of seepage was half for the integrated
safety catheter group compared to the simple needle catheter group.  By comparing the catheters presenting obstruction with those catheters without any
complication, infusing solutions and fluids, as well as corticosteroids increased the
risk for this complication. Comparing the occurrence of obstruction with other
complications for total catheters, infusing solutions and fluids increased the risk of
obstruction. A study using multivariate analysis found significant relationships between
the obstruction and gender=feminine (RR = 1.44, p < 0.001); puncture in the hand (RR
= 1.47, p < 0.001); cubital fossa (RR = 1.27, p < 0.001) and arm (RR = 1.25, p =
0.016); antimicrobial use (RR = 1.41, p < 0.001), corticosteroids (RR = 1.36, p =
0.028) and antipyretics (RR = 0.76; p = 0.030) and infection of the patient (RR = 1.27,
p < 0.001)
1
. When comparing the types of catheters, the cumulative risk rate was higher in
the integrated safety catheter group from the first day of the catheter.  By comparing the catheters that had the outcome traction with those who did not present
any complications, no significant data was obtained. When the traction was compared to
other complications, the arm region was shown as a risk factor compared to the forearm.
Other studies show risk factors different to those presented in this study, being
related to the presence of two or more comorbidities (RR = 0.78, p < 0.05); 18G the
bore (RR = 1.43, p < 0.01); puncture in the cubital fossa (RR = 1.99, p < 0.01)
and hand (RR = 2.72, p < 0.01); antipyretic management (RR = 1.50, p < 0.05) and
other drugs (RR = 1.26, p < 0.05)
1
. Multiple analysis of another study presented as risk factors the puncture site
in the hand (RR = 2.45, p < 0.001) and cubital fossa (RR = 1.65, p = 0.001); 22G or
the lower (RR = 1.29, p = 0.030)
1
. Regarding the traction survival analysis, in this research the cumulative risk
rate is lower in the integrated safety catheter group since the second day on of the
catheter.  The absence of records related to venipuncture in the patient charts limited this
research. For this reason at the end of the pilot test and in addition to the readings
in nursing notes, there was performed an active search for this information through a
daily assessment in the wards of the surveyed units, just as questions directed to the
officials and employees. Another limiting factor was the impossibility of blinding, due
to the physical characteristics of catheters. The applicability of the research results
is to assist the professional in choosing the best or most appropriate peripheral venous
catheter technology, suitable to the prescribed patients therapeutics in the care
process. The findings can permeate public policies, clinical guidelines, standards,
protocols and procedures in patient care, in order to reduce the occurrence of
complications.

BODY.CONCLUSION :
Risk factors for the development of local complications in both catheter types, lengths
of stay between 10 to 19 days, 20 to 29 days, and antimicrobial use of solutions and
fluids. In the group that used the integrated safety catheter, hospital stays between
10-19 days and in the group with simple needle catheter, lengths of stay from 20 to 29
days and the use of solutions and fluids increased the risk towards the development of
any complication. The cumulative risk rates are lower for the development of phlebitis,
seepage and traction in the integrated safety catheter group, indicating the advantage
of its use in infusing solutions and fluids, administration of corticosteroids and
antimicrobials; no risk factors associated with obstruction was found. The simple needle
catheter showed no risk factors related to the development of phlebitis, seepage and
traction.  Therefore, it is recommended that the staff acquire specific training for insertion,
maintenance and removal of catheters, in order to succeed in the first try and minimize
the risk factors associated with complications; to puncture using preferably 20G caliber
catheters in the forearm region, carry out careful monitoring of venous access in which
are administered antimicrobial solutions and fluids, corticosteroids, vesicant drugs and
electrolytes, and finally to properly record the complications of peripheral venous
catheterization in a clear, objective and complete manner. These attitudes will maximize
the survival of inserted catheters and decrease the adverse effects to the patient.
