  ABSTRACT:


BODY:
Erratum to: OBES SURG  DOI 10.1007/s11695-014-1374-z  Paragraph 6 of the Discussion states: "A further limitation to the present study is that it was conducted at a single center, with a single surgical team, and therefore the sample size is small".  This should instead state: "A further limitation to the present study is that it was conducted at two centers; however, with a single surgical team, and therefore the sample size is small".
