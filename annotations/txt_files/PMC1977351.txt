TITLE: The effect of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy on local breast recurrence in node positive breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation.

  ABSTRACT:
A randomised trial has previously been repeated in which 437 women with node positive breast cancer received either a 12-week chemohormonal regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, prednisone, adriamycin and tamoxifen or 36 weeks of CMFVP. The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04. In conclusion, our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy impacts on local breast recurrence in a similar manner to other sites in Stage II breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation. Despite the use of a conventional 36-week adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, the local breast recurrence rate was substantial.
