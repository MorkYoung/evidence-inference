The textual description of Table 2 and text are incorrectly submitted and published in the original version. These discrepancies are corrected with this erratum.  On page 5 (line 1):  "Data from the questionnaire showed that 88 % of the participants were affected by issues relating to hearing, 75 % by touch, 50 % by vision and 38 % smell (Table 2)." Instead it should say:  "Data from the questionnaire showed that 88 % of the participants were affected by issues relating to hearing, 75 % by touch, 56 % by vision and 44 % by smell (Table 2).  On page 7 (line 91):  "Robertson and Simmons (2015) also point out that being aware of stimuli that cause sensory stress and having control over them is an important method for elevating stress and anxiety." Instead it should say:  "Robertson and Simmons (2015) also point out that being aware of stimuli that cause sensory stress and having control over them is an important method for alleviating stress and anxiety."
