  ABSTRACT:


BODY:

In the paper, the dosage of telmisartan is incorrect due to a typographical error. Twelve patients, assigned to telmisartan group, received telmisartan at a dose of 40 mg, not 20 mg, once a day. The correct sentences should appear as given below."Nineteen hypertensive NAFLD patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive telmisartan at a dose of 40 mg once a day (n = 12) or losartan at a dose of 50 mg once a day (n = 7) for 12 months" in the "Methods" section of the "Abstract."
