TITLE: Repair of the Ankle Syndesmosis

ABSTRACT 
ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES:: Significant debate exists regarding the optimal repair techniques for unstable syndesmosis injuries. Techniques range from one to multiple screw fixation, suture-button fixation devices, or a combination of the two. The purpose of the current investigation was to biomechanically compare three common syndesmotic repair techniques using a simulated weight-bearing protocol with internal and external rotation of the foot.

ABSTRACT.METHODS:: Twenty-four, lower leg specimens with mean age 54.25 years (range, 38 to 68 years) were utilized for testing. Following the creation of a complete syndesmotic injury (AITFL, ITFL, PITFL, interosseous membrane) specimens were repaired using one of three randomly assigned repair techniques: (1) one 3.5 mm syndesmotic screw, (2) one suture-button construct, and (3) two divergent suture-button constructs. For testing, specimens were oriented in neutral plantar/dorsiflexion and neutral internal/external rotation with the respect to the vertical tibia. Repairs were then cycled for 500 cycles between 7.5 Nm of internal/external rotation torque under a constant 750 N axial compressive load. At 0, 10, 100, and 500 cycles, torsional cyclic loading was interrupted to assess torsional stiffness and resistance to rotation within a physiologic range of motion. While axially loaded to 750 N, the foot was externally rotated to 15째 and then rotated to 10째 of internal rotation. Torsional cyclic loading was then resumed. Torque (Nm) and rotational position (degrees) were recorded continuously throughout testing. Three-dimensional data was also collected throughout testing to characterize the relative spatial relationships of the tibiofibular articulation.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:: Biomechanically, there were no significant differences between techniques when repairs were compared to the intact syndesmosis. Three-dimensional analysis revealed significant differences between all repair techniques for sagittal fibular translation with external rotation of the foot. Screw fixation had the smallest magnitude in sagittal translation (-2.5 mm), and a single suture-button construct demonstrated the largest magnitude of sagittal translation (-4.6 mm). Screw fixation also allowed for significantly lower sagittal translation with internal rotation of the foot (0.1 mm) when compared to both one (2.7 mm) and two (2.9 mm) suture-button repair constructs.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:: All repairs provided a significant resistance to internal and external rotation, and only demonstrated mild reductions in strength and torsional stiffness throughout torsional cyclic testing.
