TITLE: Dolutegravir Plus Abacavir/Lamivudine for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection in Antiretroviral Therapy-Naive Patients: Week 96 and Week 144 Results From the SINGLE Randomized Clinical Trial: Erratum

ABSTRACT 
  ABSTRACT: 

BODY: In the article by Walmsley et al, appearing in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, Vol. 70, No. 5, pp. 515â€“519, entitled "Dolutegravir Plus Abacavir/Lamivudine for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection in Antiretroviral Therapy-Naive Patients: Week 96 and Week 144 Results From the SINGLE Randomized Clinical Trial," there is an error in the abstract text regarding the incidence of discontinuations due to adverse events through week 144. The sentence should read, "Superior efficacy was primarily driven by fewer discontinuations due to adverse events in the dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine arm [dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine arm, 16 (4%); efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine arm, 58 (14%)] through W144." The data in the body of the manuscript are correct.
