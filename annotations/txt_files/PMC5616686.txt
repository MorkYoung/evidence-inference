Abstract
  
Background: Previous research has reported evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show anxiety symptoms and neurocognitive impairments. However, the influence of anxiety on neurocognitive function in MDD patients during antidepressant treatment is unclear.  
Method: MDD patients (n=164) completed a 12-week, multicenter, randomized trial assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either tianeptine or escitalopram. Changes of anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), self-rated subjective cognitive impairment on memory and concentration, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Verbal Learning Test (VLT), and Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) were assessed every 4 weeks.  
Results: During 12 weeks of treatment, decrease in the HAM-A score was significantly associated with improvement of subjective cognitive impairments on memory (p<0.001) and concentration (p<0.001), and objective measures on delayed memory (p=0.006) and reasoning ability (p=0.002), after adjusting for covariates such as baseline HAM-A scores, time, sex, age, education years and assigned medication using the Mixed effects and Generalized Estimated Equation model analysis. However, the other cognitive outcome variables, immediate memory, commission error, and MMSE, which showed significant improvement through 12-week study period, showed no significant association with improvement of anxiety.  
Conclusion: Improvement of anxiety symptoms was significantly associated with improvement in subjective and objective neurocognitive functions such as delayed memory and reasoning ability in elderly MDD patients during antidepressant treatment, but not significantly associated with improvement of immediate memory and commission error.
