TITLE: A randomised trial of second-line hormone vs single agent chemotherapy in tamoxifen resistant advanced breast cancer.

ABSTRACT 
  ABSTRACT: Sixty patients with advanced breast cancer unresponsive to tamoxifen have been randomised to receive four course of mitozantrone, 14 mg m-2 (n = 30) intravenously every 3 weeks (9 weeks total) or megesterol acetate, 160 mg bd (n = 30). One in three patients (11 from each group) had substantial disease control for a minimum period of 6 months i.e., lack of progression; seven patients (23%) showed objective response to mitozantrone compared to four (13%) receiving megesterol. Non-progressive disease occurred in all sites, including visceral metastases and receptor negative patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the median time (5 months each) to disease progression response duration or survival (13 months megesterol, 11 months mitozantrone) from commencing second-line therapy. Toxicity was considerably higher in the mitozantrone group. Second-line hormonal therapies can produce similar therapeutic results as those achieved from a short course of a 'short option' single agent cytotoxic in patients who were previously thought hormone insensitive. Provided that the patient does not have life threatening disease a trial of megesterol acetate is worth consideration in that it does not prejudice subsequent response to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy.
