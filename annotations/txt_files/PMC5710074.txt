ABSTRACT 
  ABSTRACT: 

BODY.CORRECTION:  id="Par2">Following publication of the original article [1], the authors reported that additional file 10 contained a typing error in the table "Percentage of responders (â‰¥50% max TOTPAR) over two, four, six and eight hours (single-dose phase) (ITT Population)". The table is to be read as follows:DKP/TRAM(N = 152)DKP (N = 151)TRAM (N = 150)Placebo (N = 153)TOTPAR2

   id="Par3">TOTPAR: total pain relief; % max TOTPAR: percentage of the theoretical maximum possible TOTPAR; ITT: intention-to-treat; DKP/TRAM: dexketoprofen trometamol/tramadol hydrochloride 25 mg/75 mg; DKP: dexketoprofen trometamol 25 mg; TRAM: tramadol hydrochloride 100 mg; N: number of patients; n: number of patients with data. The ITT population included all patients randomised; response was defined as the achievement of at least 50% of the maximum possible TOTPAR within the respective treatment arm; TOTPAR was calculated as the time-weighted sum of the pain relief (PAR) scores; PAR was measured on a five-point verbal rating scale (VRS) (0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = good, 4 = complete); the percentage of PAR responders was analysed using a chi-square test.
