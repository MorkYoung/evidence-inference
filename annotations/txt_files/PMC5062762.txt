  ABSTRACT:


BODY.ERRATUM:
Following publication of the original article [1] it was brought to our attention that a mistake was overlooked during the proofing process. In the 'Authors' information' section, it is said that the second author is an associate professor of the School of Nursing, The University of Pittsburgh, USA. However, this should instead read as Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and not The University of Pittsburgh. The authors would like to apologise for any confusion caused.
